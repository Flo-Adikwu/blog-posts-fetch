# Next.js + React + TypeScript Setup

This project is a scaffolded Next.js setup using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** — ready for further feature development..

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – Strongly typed JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Utility-first CSS framework

// Basics
// Use the endpoints in https://dummyjson.com/docs/posts and/or https://dummyjson.com/docs/comments for your API requests.
// Display a list of 20 posts from the provided API
// Each item should present: title, body, the list of tags, reactions (like, dislike), views count and comments count

// Comments Basics
// Fetch and display the comments count for each post

// Global Loading Indicator
// Implement a loading indicator that is display while any data is being fetched
// The loading indicator should remain visible until all posts and all comments have been fully loaded.
// Ensure that the posts and comments are not displayed or in their loading state until the loading process is complete
// ---
// Styling
// Apply styling to the work done so far: you can use any framework of your choice (Tailwind, Bootstrap, or simply CSS or SCSS)
// Make the application visually appealing, with attention to layout, typography and spacing
